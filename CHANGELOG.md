## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Contributor documentation: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, issue and pull request templates, `CODEOWNERS`.
- Ruff lint and format checks in CI, with a `pre-commit` config.
- Dependabot for GitHub Actions and Python dependencies.

### Fixed

- `fitness_log_food` no longer reports `ok` for adds that logged the wrong
  food or nothing. MyFitnessPal's `/food/add` answers 200 for any id: an id that
  belongs to another food logs that food, and one that matches nothing logs
  nothing. `food_id` + `weight_id` must now be a pair that `fitness_search_food`
  returned in the same server process, and each add reads the diary before and
  after it. An add that created no entry is an error, and the result's new
  `logged` field lists the entries that were actually added.
- Gap-fill now keys off an explicit `diary_synced` flag instead of row
  existence. Previously a weight-only row (from `fitness_log_weight` on a past
  date, or from the weigh-in backfill after a failed day fetch) made sync treat
  that day as cached, so its calories and macros were never fetched. Existing
  databases are migrated on first open; weight-only rows are refetched on the
  next sync.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-26

### Changed

- Diary entry matching for `fitness_delete_food` and `fitness_modify_food`
  disambiguates instead of guessing when several entries match.
- Releases are tagged and published automatically when the version in
  `pyproject.toml` is bumped on `main`.

### Fixed

- `__version__` no longer drifts from `pyproject.toml`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Weight backfill no longer strands weigh-ins on days that were already cached.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `fitness_get_note` and `fitness_log_note` for reading and writing the
  MyFitnessPal daily diary note.
- Demo GIF in the README.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- MCP registry namespace case (`io.github.Mason-Levyy`).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Publishing to the MCP Registry (`server.json`, OIDC login).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- `build_client` accepts username and impersonation overrides so the client
  can be embedded in other projects.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Initial release: MCP server with diary read/write, food search, weight and
  exercise logging, trends, bulk export, cookie auth with optional headless
  auto-refresh, stdio and streamable HTTP transports. Published to PyPI as
  `mfp-mcp`.
