Connect MyFitnessPal to Claude or any MCP client. Log meals by talking, search
the food database with macros, track trends, and export your nutrition history, all against your real MyFitnessPal diary.

Published on PyPI as [`mfp-mcp`](https://pypi.org/project/mfp-mcp/).

## Why this one?

MyFitnessPal moved behind Cloudflare + NextAuth, which broke the
username/password login that most existing integrations rely on. This server:

- **Authenticates with your browser session cookie** over a real Chrome TLS
  fingerprint ([curl_cffi](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi)), which
  passes Cloudflare.
- **Auto-refreshes the session** (optional): a headless browser profile rotates
  the token when it expires, and failed calls retry automatically.
- **Writes, not just reads**: log, modify, and delete real diary entries.
- **Search-then-log**: get candidates with macros, then log the exact item.

## Quickstart

1. Connect your account (one-time; prompts you to paste a cookie — see
   [Authentication](#authentication)):

   ```bash
   uvx mfp-mcp auth
   ```

2. Add the server to your client.

   **Claude Code**

   ```bash
   claude mcp add myfitnesspal -- uvx mfp-mcp
   ```

   **Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`)

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "myfitnesspal": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["mfp-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Talk to it: *"log a banana as a snack"*, *"what did I eat yesterday?"*,
   *"chart my weight this month"*.

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Any MCP client that speaks stdio or
streamable HTTP works, not just Claude.

## Authentication

MyFitnessPal killed headless password login, so this uses your browser's
session cookie:

1. Log in at [myfitnesspal.com](https://www.myfitnesspal.com).
2. Open DevTools (F12) → **Application** (Chrome) or **Storage** (Firefox) →
   **Cookies** → `https://www.myfitnesspal.com`.
3. Copy the value of `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`.
4. Paste it into the `mfp-mcp auth` prompt (input is hidden).

Pasting the entire `Cookie:` header from any request in the Network tab also
works. Cookies are stored with owner-only permissions in your platform config
dir, or supply them via the `MFP_COOKIE` environment variable instead.

Sessions last around 30 days. When one expires, either re-run `auth` — or
enable auto-refresh so you never have to.

### Auto-refresh (recommended)

With the `autorefresh` extra, `auth` also seeds a persistent headless browser
profile. When MyFitnessPal rejects the session mid-call, the server tells your
client it is retrying, boots the profile headlessly, lets MyFitnessPal rotate
the session token, saves the fresh cookie, and retries the call.

```bash
uvx --from 'mfp-mcp[autorefresh]' playwright install chromium
uvx --from 'mfp-mcp[autorefresh]' mfp-mcp auth
```

Then use the same `--from 'mfp-mcp[autorefresh]'` form in your client config
(e.g. `uvx --from 'mfp-mcp[autorefresh]' mfp-mcp`).

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `fitness_get_day` | Nutrition totals, diary entries, the MFP daily note, and feel note for a day |
| `fitness_search_food` | Candidate matches with brand, calories, macros, serving, and ids |
| `fitness_log_food` | Log a food to the real diary (top match, or an exact search candidate) |
| `fitness_delete_food` | Remove a diary entry by name match |
| `fitness_modify_food` | Replace an entry (or change its quantity) |
| `fitness_list_custom` | Your custom foods ("My Foods"), saved meals and recipes, with ids, servings and nutrition |
| `fitness_log_custom` | Log one of those by name; a saved meal is logged as its ingredients |
| `fitness_create_food` | Create a private custom food |
| `fitness_create_meal` | Save one logged meal of a day as a named saved meal ("Remember Meal") |
| `fitness_create_recipe` | Create a private recipe from searched foods; MFP computes its nutrition |
| `fitness_delete_custom` | Delete a custom food, saved meal or recipe (exact name only) |
| `fitness_complete_day` | Mark a day complete ("Complete This Entry"), reopen it, or check it |
| `fitness_log_weight` | Log a weight measurement (updates the same day on re-log) |
| `fitness_get_exercise` | Read the exercise diary (cardio + strength) |
| `fitness_get_note` | Read the MyFitnessPal daily diary note (the "Notes" box) for a day |
| `fitness_log_note` | Write that daily note to MFP (replace, or `append` a new line) |
| `fitness_log_feel` | Save a subjective "how I feel" note (stored locally, never sent to MFP) |
| `fitness_get_trends` | One metric over a date range: weight, calories_in, protein, carbs, fat |
| `fitness_bulk_export` | Whole date range in one call, for analysis (incl. whether each day is marked complete) |

The high-accuracy logging flow: `fitness_search_food("greek yogurt")` returns
candidates with macros and a `food_id`/`weight_id`; pass those to
`fitness_log_food` to log exactly that item instead of trusting the top match.

Your own items work the same way: `fitness_list_custom(kind="meals")` shows
each saved meal with its ingredients, and `fitness_log_custom("My protein
shake", meal="breakfast")` logs it; the result's `logged` field lists the
entries MyFitnessPal actually added. To build a saved meal, log its foods into
one meal of a day, then `fitness_create_meal("Office breakfast",
meal="breakfast")`. A recipe takes the `external_id` of each ingredient from
`fitness_search_food`, plus how many of which serving:
`fitness_create_recipe("Banana bread", 8, [{"external_id": "...",
"quantity": 3, "serving": "cup"}])`.

Day summaries and trends read from a local SQLite cache that gap-fills from
MyFitnessPal (first call on a fresh install fetches up to 30 days, one request
per day — subsequent calls are fast).

Water intake is read-only (it appears in day summaries): MyFitnessPal's water
*write* isn't exposed on any endpoint we've found — `/food/water` accepts POSTs
but ignores them. If you capture the real call in your browser, a PR is very
welcome.

## Remote / HTTP mode

The default transport is stdio. For network clients:

```bash
mfp-mcp --http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8484
```

This serves streamable HTTP at `/mcp`. **There is no built-in authentication —
never expose it to the internet.** Bind to localhost and front it with
something that authenticates for you: a VPN/tailnet (e.g. `tailscale serve`),
an authenticating reverse proxy, or an OAuth-aware MCP gateway.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MFP_COOKIE` | Session cookie (full header or bare token); overrides the saved file | – |
| `MFP_USERNAME` | Your MFP username (not email); only needed if profile lookup fails | auto-detected |
| `MFP_IMPERSONATE` | curl_cffi browser fingerprint (try `chrome124` on 403s) | `chrome` |
| `MFP_SYNC_DAYS` | Gap-fill lookback window in days | `30` |
| `MFP_MCP_DATA_DIR` | Where the SQLite cache + browser profile live | platform data dir |

## Troubleshooting

- **403 / Cloudflare blocked**: try `MFP_IMPERSONATE=chrome124` (or another
  [curl_cffi target](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi#supported-browsers)).
  Datacenter IPs get challenged far more than residential ones.
- **"Session expired"**: re-run `mfp-mcp auth`, or set up
  [auto-refresh](#auto-refresh-recommended).
- **"couldn't read your MyFitnessPal profile"**: MFP's profile endpoint 500s
  for some accounts. Set `MFP_USERNAME` to your username (not your email).
- **curl_cffi install issues**: prebuilt wheels cover Linux/macOS/Windows;
  musl (Alpine) builds from source.

## How it works

- [python-myfitnesspal](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal)
  parses the diary, measurements, and exercise pages — run over a `curl_cffi`
  session that impersonates Chrome's TLS fingerprint so Cloudflare lets it
  through with just the NextAuth session cookie.
- Writes replicate the web app's own XHR calls: the legacy food-search page
  supplies the `food_id`/`weight_id` that `/food/add` accepts, deletes go
  through `/food/remove`, and the daily note reads/writes via `/food/note` —
  each with the page CSRF token.
- Day summaries, trends, and exports read a local SQLite cache that gap-fills
  missing days. The MyFitnessPal daily note syncs both ways; feel notes are
  local-only.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mason-Levyy/myfitnesspal-mcp
cd myfitnesspal-mcp
uv sync --extra autorefresh
uv run pytest
```

Tests run against synthetic MyFitnessPal HTML/JSON fixtures — no account
needed. Lint and formatting are enforced with `ruff` (`uv run ruff check .`,
`uv run ruff format .`).
